The breakout board gives access to the Rx and Tx pins of the LoRa module. Apart from that there are 4 status LEDS for showing the current status of the module. 
Then there is a mode selector switch as well for the M0 and M1 switches.

You can find the [datasheet of the module HERE](http://www.ebyte.com/en/downpdf.aspx?id=132).
